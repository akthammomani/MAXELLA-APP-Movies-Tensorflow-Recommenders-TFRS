## Dataset: 

**Movie Lens** contains a set of movie ratings from the MovieLens website, a movie recommendation service. This dataset was collected and maintained by [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/) , a research group at the University of Minnesota. There are 5 versions included: "25m", "latest-small", "100k", "1m", "20m". In all datasets, the movies data and ratings data are joined on "movieId". The 25m dataset, latest-small dataset, and 20m dataset contain only movie data and rating data. The 1m dataset and 100k dataset contain demographic data in addition to movie and rating data.
